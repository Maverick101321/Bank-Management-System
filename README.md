# Bank Management System

### This project is part of my coursework for the Database Management System (DBMS) course in my University's curriculum. As web development is not my area of expertise, this project was an exploration into building a simple Bank Management System web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Bank Management System consists of two main parts: the login page and the dashboard. The login page allows users to enter their username and password to access the system. Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard, which provides various options such as viewing customer details, account information, branch information, transactions, loans, credit cards, and investments.

## Features

### - User-friendly login page with "Welcome to" greeting in green text.
### - Interactive dashboard with clickable options.
### - Details displayed directly in the dashboard boxes without the need to click.
### - Subtle animation on hovering over the dashboard boxes.
### - Logout button to return to the login page.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
### 2. Open the `login.html` file in a web browser to access the login page.
### 3. Enter the username and password (sample credentials: username - admin, password - admin123).
### 4. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the dashboard.
### 5. Click on any of the options on the dashboard to view sample information.
